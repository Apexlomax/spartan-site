            Before jumping into the DAO and proposing or voting on changes to
            the protocol, make sure you read the below documentation. It is

            parameters could be changed by your decisions. Always research and
            leverage community debate before voting on a proposal in the DAO.

            A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is unlike any
            hierarchical controled structure from a traditional organisation.
            Centralised exchanges are an example of this; you might want a token
            listed, but besides banding the community together and carrying out
            a Twitter barrage, you have very little influence on that decision
            coming to fruition.<br /><br />
            DAOs place some control into the hands of the community participants
            of the platform transparently and programmatically. The power of
            contracts enforced by mathematics means that a large number of
            automated actions within a contract can be set up and voted on, the
            results of which will be automatically actioned. This would mean the
            community would be able to propose and vote on which tokens they
            want to be listed. On a successful vote, these tokens would be
            automatically listed. Resistant to external entities, governments
            and bad actors getting in the way of that decision.<br /><br />

        </h2>
        <p>
          The community should already be familiar with the Spartan Protocol
          ethos being; "birthed by the community for the community" with the
          initial developers building the platform the way they wanted to see it
          within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Chosen for its power, speed
          and low fees.<br />
          Having Spartan Protocol run by a DAO was a central pillar of its
          development. The intent is to release the DAO in stages to familiarise
          the community with these powerful decentralised decision-making
          features.<br /><br />
          Spartan Protocol's DAO is open source, which means the code can be
          viewed by anyone. Moreover, all of the rules and financial
          transactions are recorded in the Blockchain. This makes the DAO
          transparent, immutable and most importantly, resistant to
          corruption.<br /><br />
          It's also worth noting that with DAOv2, there will be a "Grant"
          feature implemented. This will allow the community to send a SPARTA
          grant to a wallet address. The community may choose to reward the
          active contributors, or maybe even draw some more in by sending a
          grant to a trusted community member to share it out as bounties for
          fixing things, or to develop something new all together.<br /><br />
          Only curated pool's LP tokens can be staked in the DaoVault, which is
          a deliberate decision to drive liquidity into the important pools.
          More liquidity in the pools means lower slippage for token swaps,
          which inturn means more incentive for users to utilise the Spartan
          Pools.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <h4 class="mb-3">Use your LP Tokens in the DAO</h4>
        <li>
          Stake them in the DAOVault to gain voting rights with governing the
          protocol
        </li>
        <li>
          Staking in the DAOVault also enables you to earn extra SPARTA through
          'Harvesting'
        </li>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          By staking in the DAO, not only will you be eligible to harvest SPARTA
          yield, but you will also have the usual slip fees + dividends go
          directly into the liquidity pools which your LP tokens can be redeemed
          for. <br /><br />
          In order to incentivise community participation in the DAO, SPARTA
          emissions will be directed to stakers through the DAOVault contract.
          You will in real-time accrue SPARTA that can be harvested.

        <p>
          The community continues to drive Spartan Protocol and if you want to
          join the DAO, it is hoped that you join it with the intent to see it
          succeed, grow and prosper for the LONG TERM. We should focus on
          proposals that will benefit the platform in the long run, that means
          focusing on things that help it grow, develop and improve reach before
          focusing on individual benefit. Community value will drive results in
          individual benefit, it most likely won't work the other way around.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 class="mb-4">
          Get involved and influence the direction of Spartan Protocol
        </h4>
        <p>
          To have your say with proposing assets you must be providing weight in
          the DAO. To do this you must:
        </p>
        <li>
          Provide liquidity to the pools — When you add liquidity to a pool you
          will receive LP tokens representing your weight in the relative pool.
        </li>
        <li>Lock LP tokens in the DaoVault</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can either vote on current proposals or put forward your own. View
          the current pending proposal and vote if you agree with it. Voting in
          support of a proposal does not attract any fees other than "gas" which
          thanks to BSC is insignificant when compared to other chains.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4 class="mb-4">Proposals from anyone in the community</h4>
        <p>
          If you want to submit a new proposal there is a SPARTA fee for it to
          be listed. This is done to discourage spam proposals and ensure the
          proposal being put forward has been thought about. The fee is
          allocated to the RESERVE contract which will eventually be emitted
          back out via incentives.<br /><br />
          If a proposal reaches it's required consensus (50% or 66% depending on
          the severity of the proposed action), it can be switched over to
          "finalising" status by anyone calling the smart contract function,
          where it will sit for the "CoolOffPeriod" (currently set at 3 days).
          After the "CoolOffPeriod" has passed, anyone can attempt to finalise
          the proposal where it will recalculate and if still above 50%
          consensus will automatically run the required function/s to make the
          proposed action happen.<br /><br />
          If you want to vote against the proposal all you need to do
          is….nothing. Well, except ensuring you have some weight in the DAO
          that is NOT voted "for" the proposal. By not voting you are voting
          "no" on the proposal. The intent is that proposals will need to be
          actively communicated within the community channels on telegram,
          debated, refined and then collectivity moved forward. The majority of
          the community will need to support the proposal to get it to move
          forward.

            Once you have decided to jump on board, you will be able to have
            your say and help to steer the project towards a prosperous future.
            You will need to stake your LP tokens into the DAOVault.<br /><br />
            The higher the liquidity you provide to the protocol, the more
            liquidity tokens you will have to be able to lock in the DAO and
            therefore the more voting power that you will have for the direction
            of the platform.<br /><br />
            The DAO proposal page will allow you to interact with the DAO
            proposals. This is where you can either vote towards current
            proposals or even create your own. Together, the community will
            drive this project forwards.
